# movie_ticket_calculator

A simple movie ticket calculator that calculates the total price for the number of adult and child tickets you need.

This simple calculator allowed me to practice importing packages (datetime) as well as decision making code using an if/else statement.

I learned not only how to get the current time, but also only display the "hour" of time in order to determine if we are selling all tickets at the Matinee price instead of 2 different ticket prices.
